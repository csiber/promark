# ARK Survival Evolved Server Website

**ARK Survival Evolved Server Website** was a custom-built frontend dashboard  
created to support and manage a dedicated ARK: Survival Evolved game server.  

The project provided a **community-facing portal** where players could view server status,  
rules, and updates – while admins could monitor activity and manage key settings.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎮 **Server Status Dashboard** – live player count, uptime, and performance  
- 📖 **Community Pages** – rules, FAQs, and game-related guides  
- 🗂️ **Admin Tools** – basic controls for server management (planned)  
- 🔐 **Authentication** – restricted admin access for protected features  
- 🎨 **Themed UI** – dark/light modes for better readability

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TailwindCSS)  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (initial prototype), could also run on Cloudflare Pages  
- **Backend Integration:** Server API endpoints for ARK (RCON / REST)  
- **UI Components:** React Bootstrap for fast prototyping  
- **Extras:** i18n for multi-language support, auto sitemap for SEO

## 📅 Project Status

✅ **Prototype Completed** – the site successfully showcased server status  
and served as a hub for the ARK community.  

🚧 Further development (admin tools, player stats, in-game integration)  
was planned but not fully implemented.

## 🌍 Context

This project was part of my early experiments in combining:  
- **Game server hosting**  
- **Modern frontend frameworks (Next.js)**  
- **Community-driven features**  

It laid the foundation for later projects in the **HSWLP ecosystem**  
such as **PlayCore** (game server hosting dashboard) and other SaaS tools.
